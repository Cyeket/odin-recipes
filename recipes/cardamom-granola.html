      <h2>Cardamom Granola Ingredients (serves 4)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>330g oats</li>
          <li>100g of mixed nuts (Almonds, Hazelnuts, Brazilian nuts work well)</li>
          <li>100g of mixed seeds (Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds work well)</li>
          <li>6 green cardamom pods</li>
          <li>6 tablespoons of maple syrup</li>
          <li>S1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>Sea salt</li>
          <li>6 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C (fan 160C, or gas mark 4)</li>  
            <li>Deskin your hazelnuts if you cannot buy them without skins, To do this, add hazelnuts to a baking tray, and place in your preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let them cool for 5 minutes after, then rub in your hands so the skins will easily fall off.</li>
            <li>Finely chop up nuts.</li>
            <li>Add all your dry ingredients to a baking tray. Add your oats, then the chopped nuts, then your seeds last.</li>
            <li>Crush your cardamom pods to remove the seeds within. Sprinkle the seeds into the baking tray, and then add your cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of sea salt. Mix this all together.</li>
            <li>Roast granola in oven for 40 mins and stir every 10 mins.</li>
            <li>When golden brown, your granola will be finished.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favourite yoghurt.</li>
          </ol>
